			<h1 id="page-header">Summary</h1>
			<p><i>The Sea Runners</i> by Ivan Doig is a novel about escape, adventure, and survival.</p>
			
			<blockquote>“Odd, the deceit of distance. How it was that men would brave the miles to a new place, the very total of those miles seeming to promise a higher life than the old, and then find the work dull, the wage never quite totting up to what it should, the food worse than ever―the longing to be elsewhere now pivoted straight around. Yes, that was the way for a seven-year man, distance played these tricks as if a spyglass had spun end-for-end in his hands” (11).</blockquote>
			<p>The story takes place in 1853. Four "seven-year men" indentured in Russian Alaska attempt an escape from the colonial enterprise in New Archangel. This is no easy task. Weather, starvation, hostile Tlinget natives, distrust, and the sea itself all threaten their lives, as the group sails and paddles to the nearest port town of Astoria, Oregon, hundreds of miles down the wild coastline. </p>

				<h2 id="sub-header">Content Explained</h2>
				<p>For each character site, I used five universal elements. First, the top of each page features a direct quote from the character that helps provide insight onto their motivations, skill, or character traits. Mostly the top quote serves to introduce the characters and attract the user's attention.
				Second, I included a short written description of each character. This might include how they came to be a part of the escape, their contributions to it, or their origins, depending on what aspects are most important for establishing each character.
				Third and fourth are quotations from the text that give descriptions on the characters' physique and skillset, respectively.
				At the bottom of each page is an image that illustrates the characters skillset or origin. I specifically chose images that originate from the nineteenth century because they match the timeframe of the story, therefore providing the best representation of the characters. Each image is complete with a descriptive caption and links back to it's origin.</p>
