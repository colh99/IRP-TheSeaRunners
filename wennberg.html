			<blockquote id="top-quote">“‘You’ve plans to crawl out of this Russian bear pit, and I’m coming with you…else you and Braaf and Karlsson’ll be in irons and off to pass your years in Siberia’” (47).</blockquote>
			<p>The observant Wennberg works as a blacksmith in New Archangel, and he catches on that Melander, Karlsson, and Braaf are planning to escape, and has noticed where Braaf has stored the stolen supplies. He confronts the group, and threatens to rat them out unless he can join them. Melander allows him to join the escape, but since they can't trust Wennberg, he has Braaf move the supplies, so Wennberg has no proof if he tells the Russians. This is a good move, since Wennberg himself isn't completely sure about his decision to tag along.</p>

			<blockquote>“Their newcomer was both hefty and wide, like a cut of very broad plank. An unexpectedness atop his girth was the fluffy set of sideburns―light brown, as against the blondeness of the other three Swedes―which framed his face all the way down to where his jaw joined his neck” (50).</blockquote>
			<p style="padding-left:30px">Skillset:</p>
			<blockquote>"The middle of this structure was transected by the smithing shop and within its open arched doorway stood three huge forges, aligned from the outside in like stabled iron creatures. The outermost of these dusky fire bins was Wennberg's." (47).</blockquote>
