			<blockquote id="top-quote">"Why're you coming on the escape?"<br/>"Maybe to see how it'll be" (62).</blockquote>
			<p>Karlsson lives up to the supposed stereotype of his homeland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Småland">Småland</a>, being taciturn and keeping most thought to himself. As such, he flies under the radar and <a href="http://www.literarydevices.com/hook/">his personal motivations are unclear</a>, however he trusts Melander's planning. Melander sees the value in Karlsson's canoeing skill, but he is also an adequate woodsman, so he can help hunt for additional food if needed.</p>
			<p style="padding-left:30px">Physical Description:</p>
			<blockquote>“There always was about this Karlsson a calm just short of chill. He was a Smålander, and that ilk were known to have in them whatever stone God had left over after He filled their fields with it” (19).</blockquote>
			<p style="padding-left:30px">Skillset:</p>
			<blockquote>“A time, he had noticed Karlsson canoeing in across Sitka Sound here, back from a day’s hunting. Karlsson’s thrifty strokes went beyond steady. Tireless, in a neat-handed, workaday fashion. The regularity of a small millwheel, Melander had been put in mind of as he watched Karlsson paddle” (15).</blockquote>
