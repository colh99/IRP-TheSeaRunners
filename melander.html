			<blockquote id="top-quote">“‘Had I been born with brass on my corners, you’d one day be calling me Admiral,’” (6).</blockquote>
			<p>As the one planning the escape, Melander becomes the group's de facto leader. He originally signed on as first mate on a steam ship based in New Archangel. However, because the ship requires so much fuel to use, it is rarely put to use, and Melander finds himself "in charge of the crew that salted catches of salmon and herring for New Archangel’s winter larder” (9), a job significantly less desirable, especially considering the seven year term, and Melander's proven sailing career.</p>
			<p style="padding-left:30px">Physical Description:</p>
			<blockquote>“Melander, you would have spied early. Toplofty man with lanks of arms and high hips, so that he seemed to be all long sections and hinges. His line of jaw ran on as well, and so too his forehead; in the extent of Melander only the bright blue eyes and stub nose and short mouth neighbored closely, a sudden alert center of face amid the jaw-and-forehead expanse as if peering in wily surprise out of the hole of a tree trunk” (5).</blockquote>
			<p style="padding-left:30px">Skillset:</p>
			<blockquote>“Aboard ship he proved rapidly apt, the type of sea roamer of whom it was appraised that <a href="http://www.literarydevices.com/metaphor/">each drop of his blood was black Stockholm tar and every hair a rope yarn</a>” (6).</blockquote>
